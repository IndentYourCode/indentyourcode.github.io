# What is this place?!

Hey folks, if you found your way here I'm honored. Thanks for taking the time to check out the repo.

I'm a computer science major, tech geek, game designer, and writer. However... My ADHD which means I'm often all of these things, and frequently *none of them*. This is because my attention shifts drastically, constantly. In additon, my perfectionism stops me from completing projects that I really care about. I've honstly lost chance of the number of times I've "started" a blog. I've attempted with static html/css, javascript with React.js, Golang, I've looked at hosting on netlify, EC2, I've gotten quite far in all of these. What I needed was something that was quick and to the point.

So here's the workflow I've developed now.

1) Docker compose for wordpress. Write posts, modify themes, enhance layout, etc.
2) Simply static to export a static version of my wordpress blog.
3) Push changes to github repo for github pages.

This has allowed me to learn a lot, very quickly, and begin creating content. Because it's posted on github, it means I could very easily change or modify the site as time goes on.
